# iot_project
This is aims at introducing the general concepts and architecture of IoT applications, networking technologies involved, IoT development kits including Raspberry Pi, Arduino, Samsung ARTIK, and how to program them.

## 1. Blink led with various software by using artik
Having tried out some basic commands on your ARTIK developer board, you'll naturally want to start programming it. In this example, we'll do the IoT universe's equivalent of the famous "Hello World" program – use ARTIK to blink an LED.

We'll begin by doing it manually through the Linux® command line, and then compare that to doing it programmatically using:

- Arduino IDE and its library for ARTIK
- Python
- C code.

## 2. Temperature and humidity check by using google cloud iot
The python script logs temperature and humidity data from a DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor via a RaspberryPi. it then pushes that information up to an endpoint.

## 3. Temperature and humidity check by using microsoft azure
C script logs temperature and humidity data from a DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor via a RaspberryPi. it then pushes that information up to an endpoint. I am personally using Microsoft Azure Logic App for this functionality.

## 4. Temperature and humidity check by using samsung artik
C script logs temperature and humidity data from a DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor via a Samsung ARTIK. it then pushes that information up to an endpoint.

## 5. Smart door knob
