# azure-iot-temp-humidity

C script logs temperature and humidity data from a DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor via a RaspberryPi. it then pushes that information up to an endpoint. I am personally using Microsoft Azure Logic App for this functionality.

## Hardware Needed
The following is a list of the exact hardware I've tested this on:
- RaspberryPi Zero
- DHT11 3-pin sensor
