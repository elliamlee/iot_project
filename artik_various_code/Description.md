# ARTIK Projects

## Blink an LED

Having tried out some basic commands on your ARTIK developer board, you'll naturally want to start programming it. In this example, we'll do the IoT universe's equivalent of the famous "Hello World" program – use ARTIK to blink an LED.

We'll begin by doing it manually through the Linux® command line, and then compare that to doing it programmatically using:

- Arduino IDE and its library for ARTIK
- Python
- C code.

## Hardware Required
- ARTIK 5, 7, or 10 development board
- LED
- 220 ohm resistor
- Breadboard and connector wires
